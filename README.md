> Self-hosted resources from index.html

Any `<link rel="stylesheet">` and `<script>` elements that point to external URLs are fetched
at build time and saved to the `outDir` to be self-hosted. The resources will have a content 
hash in their name, so [`Cache-Control: immutable`](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/cache-control-immutable) can be used.

Within self-hosted `.css` files, any `url()` expressions that point to external URLs are also
fetched and saved to the `outDir` to be self-hosted.

**Note:** This plugin depends on [#1675](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/1675)
